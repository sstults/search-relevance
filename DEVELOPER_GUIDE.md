# Developer Guide

## Getting Started
Please define the OpenSearch version in `build.gradle`. By default, we're developing with `3.0.0-alpha1-SNAPSHOT`

### Fork OpenSearch search-relevance Repo

Fork this repository on GitHub, and clone locally with `git clone`.

Example:
```
git clone https://github.com/[your username]/search-relevance.git
```

### Install Prerequisites

#### JDK 21

OpenSearch builds using Java 21 at a minimum. This means you must have a JDK 21 installed with the environment variable
`JAVA_HOME` referencing the path to Java home for your JDK 21 installation, e.g. `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-21`.

One easy way to get Java 21 on *nix is to use [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/).

```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source ~/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh
sdk install java 21.0.2-open
sdk use java 21.0.2-open
``````

JDK versions 21 and 23 were tested and are fully supported for local development.

## Use an Editor

### IntelliJ IDEA

When importing into IntelliJ you will need to define an appropriate JDK. The convention is that **this SDK should be named "11"**, and the project import will detect it automatically. For more details on defining an SDK in IntelliJ please refer to [this documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#define-sdk). Note that SDK definitions are global, so you can add the JDK from any project, or after project import. Importing with a missing JDK will still work, IntelliJ will report a problem and will refuse to build until resolved.

You can import the OpenSearch project into IntelliJ IDEA as follows.

1. Select **File > Open**
2. In the subsequent dialog navigate to the root `build.gradle` file
3. In the subsequent dialog select **Open as Project**

## Java Language Formatting Guidelines

Taken from [OpenSearch's guidelines](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md):

Java files in the OpenSearch codebase are formatted with the Eclipse JDT formatter, using the [Spotless Gradle](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/master/plugin-gradle) plugin. The formatting check can be run explicitly with:

    ./gradlew spotlessJavaCheck

The code can be formatted with:

    ./gradlew spotlessApply

## Build

OpenSearch search-relevance uses a [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/6.6.1/userguide/userguide.html) wrapper for its build.
Run `gradlew` on Unix systems.

Build OpenSearch search-relevance using `gradlew build`

```
./gradlew build
```

## Run OpenSearch search-relevance

### Run Single-node Cluster Locally
Run OpenSearch search-relevance using `gradlew run`.

```shell script
./gradlew run
```
That will build OpenSearch and start it, writing its log above Gradle's status message. We log a lot of stuff on startup, specifically these lines tell you that plugin is ready.
```
[2023-10-24T16:26:24,789][INFO ][o.o.h.AbstractHttpServerTransport] [integTest-0] publish_address {127.0.0.1:9200}, bound_addresses {[::1]:9200}, {127.0.0.1:9200}
[2023-10-24T16:26:24,793][INFO ][o.o.n.Node               ] [integTest-0] started
```

It's typically easier to wait until the console stops scrolling, and then run `curl` in another window to check if OpenSearch instance is running.

```bash
curl localhost:9200
